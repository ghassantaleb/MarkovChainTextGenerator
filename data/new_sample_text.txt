To be, or not to be, that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them.
All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players; they have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his time plays many parts, his acts being seven ages.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.
In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on.
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
